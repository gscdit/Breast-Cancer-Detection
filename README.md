# Breast Cancer

Cancer occurs when changes called mutations take place in genes that regulate cell growth. The mutations let the cells divide and multiply in an uncontrolled, chaotic way. The cells keep on proliferating, producing copies that get progressively more abnormal. In most cases, the cell copies eventually end up forming a tumor.

Breast cancer occurs when a malignant (cancerous) tumor originates in the breast. As breast cancer tumors mature, they may metastasize (spread) to other parts of the body. The primary route of metastasis is the lymphatic system which, ironically enough, is also the body's primary system for producing and transporting white blood cells and other cancer-fighting immune system cells throughout the body. Metastasized cancer cells that aren't destroyed by the lymphatic system's white blood cells move through the lymphatic vessels and settle in remote body locations, forming new tumors and perpetuating the disease process.

Breast cancer is not just a woman's disease. It is quite possible for men to get breast cancer, although it occurs less frequently in men than in women. Our discussion will focus primarily on breast cancer as it relates to women but it should be noted that much of the information is also applicable for men.

# Facts And Figures

Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer in women and the second most common cancer overall. There were over 2 million new cases in 2018.

**Incidence rates per 100,000 women**

1) Countries with highest incidence:
   The Netherlands: 95.3
   France: 94.6
   U.S: (white people only - other races have lower incidence): 90.6

2) Countries with lowest incidence:

   Thailand: 25.6
   Algeria: 29.8
   India: 30.9
   
(Data from Global Cancer Facts and Figures, 3rd Edition, page 42)

The American Cancer Society's estimates for breast cancer in the United States for 2019 are: 

--> About 268,600 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women. 

--> About 62,930 new cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS) will be diagnosed (CIS is non-invasive and is the earliest form of breast cancer).

--> About 41,760 women will die from breast cancer.

# Conventional Method To Detect Breast Cancer 

**Mammography**

A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast. It can be used to check for breast cancer in women who have no signs or symptoms of the disease. It can also be used if you have a lump or other sign of breast cancer.

Screening mammography is the type of mammogram that checks you when you have no symptoms. It can help reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer among women ages 40 to 70. But it can also have drawbacks. Mammograms can sometimes find something that looks abnormal but isn't cancer. This leads to further testing and can cause you anxiety. Sometimes mammograms can miss cancer when it is there. It also exposes you to radiation. You should talk to your doctor about the benefits and drawbacks of mammograms. Together, you can decide when to start and how often to have a mammogram.

Mammograms are also recommended for younger women who have symptoms of breast cancer or who have a high risk of the disease.

When you have a mammogram, you stand in front of an x-ray machine. The person who takes the x-rays places your breast between two plastic plates. The plates press your breast and make it flat. This may be uncomfortable, but it helps get a clear picture. You should get a written report of your mammogram results within 30 days.

# Dis-Advantages Of Using Conventional Method (Mammography)

1) Radiation Risk and Other Risks.
2) Risk of False Alarm.
3) Expensive.
4) Time Consuming.
5) Overdiagnosis.

# Modern Ways of Detecting Breast Cancer

CAD is pattern recognition software that identifies suspicious abnormalities on images, marking them for the radiologist. CAD also stands for computer-aided diagnosis, which refers to a system that marks benign or malignant images, and the two acronyms are often confused. The most popular CAD system is the R2 Image Checker (R2 Technology, Inc., Santa Clara, CA), which combines detection and diagnosis
